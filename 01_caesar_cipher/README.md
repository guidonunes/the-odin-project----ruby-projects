# Project: Caesar Cipher - Ruby Course

## Assignment

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## My solution

* Create an array containing all the lowercase letters of the alphabet; 
* Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted message;
* Convert the message to lowercase (not destructively);
* Iterate through each character in the lowecase message to check if the character is alphabetic
* Find the index of the character in the alphabet;
* Apply the Caesar Cipher shifting logic and append the shifted character to the encrypted message
